                 <p>KG Hospital,a quaternary care,multispecialty hospital, has been at the cutting edge of medicine while staying true to its charitable mission and providing advanced yet affordable healthcare since 1974.

        prestigious Platinum DL Shah Award from the Quality Council of India.

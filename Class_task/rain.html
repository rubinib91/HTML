        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="Introduction picture">
        <p>The rainy season in Chennai plays a very important role in the city’s climate and water supply. Unlike many
            other
            parts of India that depend mainly on the Southwest Monsoon, Chennai receives most of its rainfall from the
            Northeast Monsoon, which occurs between October and December. During this time, moist winds from the Bay of
            Bengal bring heavy showers, sometimes accompanied by cyclones. The rainfall not only cools down the hot
            weather
            but also replenishes lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater, which are essential for drinking water and
            agriculture.
            However, the rainy season also brings challenges such as flooding, traffic disruptions, and waterlogging in
            many
            parts of the city. Despite these issues, the rains are considered a lifeline for Chennai, helping the city
            prepare for the dry summer months.</p>

            <p>Impact on Daily Life
                The rainy season in Chennai has a significant impact on daily life. Heavy and sudden showers often lead
                to waterlogging on streets, making commuting difficult and slowing down traffic. Public transportation
                and office timings are frequently affected, and schools may sometimes close during intense rains. The
                storms and high winds can cause electricity cuts, fallen trees, and property damage. In addition,
                stagnant water after rains increases the risk of mosquito-borne diseases and other health issues.
                Despite these challenges, the rains provide relief from the hot weather and are essential for
                replenishing water sources that sustain the city throughout the year.</p>

            <h2>Reasons For Rainfall</h2>
            <p>The main reason for rainfall in Chennai is the Northeast Monsoon, which occurs between October and
                December. During this season, winds from the Bay of Bengal carry a large amount of moisture and move
                towards the Tamil Nadu coast, causing heavy showers. Unlike most parts of India that receive rain from
                the Southwest Monsoon, Chennai depends more on the Northeast Monsoon for its annual rainfall. In
                addition, cyclones and depressions formed over the Bay of Bengal often bring intense downpours and
                storms to the city. This combination of seasonal winds and cyclonic activity makes the rainy season in
                Chennai both crucial for water supply and sometimes challenging due to flooding.all</p>

        <h2>Agriculture and water Issues</h2>
    <p>The rainy season in Chennai is very important for both agriculture and water supply. The heavy rains during the
        Northeast Monsoon help to recharge lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater sources that provide drinking water to the
        city. Without this seasonal rainfall, Chennai often faces water scarcity in the summer months. For farmers in
        nearby rural areas, the rains are a lifeline, as they depend on this water for growing crops like paddy,
        sugarcane, and vegetables. Adequate rainfall ensures good harvests, while too little or excessive rain can
        affect farming badly. Thus, the monsoon plays a key role in maintaining both the cityâ€™s water needs and the
        agricultural economy around Chennai.</p>
